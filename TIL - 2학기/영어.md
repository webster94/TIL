2021.1.30 REST API 에 대하여

```
Representational state transfer (REST) is a de-facto standard for a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web services. In order to be used in a REST-based application, a Web Service needs to meet certain constraints; such a Web Service is called RESTful. A RESTful Web service is required to provide an application access to its Web resources in a textual representation and support reading and modification of them with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations. By being RESTful, Web Services provide interoperability between the computer systems on the internet that provide these services. REST offers an alternative to, for instance, SOAP as method of access to a Web Service.[1]

"Web resources" were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses every thing, entity, or action that can be identified, named, addressed, handled, or performed, in any way whatsoever, on the Web. In a RESTful Web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response with a payload formatted in HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format. The response can confirm that some alteration has been made to the resource state, and the response can provide hypertext links to other related resources. When HTTP is used, as is most common, the operations (HTTP methods) available are GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS and TRACE.[2]

By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow by reusing components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running.

The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation.[3][4] Fielding's dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the "HTTP object model" beginning in 1994, and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) standards.[5][6] The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting resource identifiers such as http://www.example.com/articles/21 and resource operations such as GET or POST (application state transitions), resulting in the next resource's representation (the next application state) being transferred to the end user for their use.

Sass에 대하여

```
Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

If you’re looking for an introduction to Sass, check out the tutorial.

If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than the built-in module reference.

If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the JS API documentation.

Or the Dart API documentation if you’re calling it from Dart.

Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference!

500x Response (Server Errors)
And now we have reached our main protagonist. The 500 errors. As you can see, these are important errors and are always related to the server itself. Server errors are important because they can effectively crash your website. Of these errors, the most important are:

A 503 Service unavailable
A 502 bad gateway error
A 500 internal server error
Let’s explore the 3 of them by order of importance.

503 Service Unavailable
The least serious is the 503 service unavailable. If this error shows up you have a resource problem on the webserver. Almost all the time it shows up when your server is overloaded. In plain terms, if you see this error, know that it is temporary and it is directly related to too much traffic and this is overloading the CPU. Whenever the CPU and the webserver itself can’t process more incoming connections because it has reached a 100% CPU utilization, you will see this error popup.

You can fix this is by either switching to a better webserver (from Apache to Nginx for example) or by implementing a WordPress caching plugin on your site.

502 Bad Gateway
This is what I called the misconfiguration error. This error does not show up for no reason. If you ever have this error, the most probably cause is that you did something and you did it wrong. This happens usually when folks attempt to tweak Apache and PHP configuration or when trying to optimize nginx. The bad gateway is an error that almost always happens when the PHP FPM (Fast Process Manager) loses connection. Either from tweaking the wrong settings or because the process crashed. This leads the webserver to respond with a bad gateway.

The easiest way to fix this error is to double check your PHP-FPM configuration as that is the most probable cause for this error. This happens more often on the Nginx side than on Apache and almost never happens on hosting services provided by cPanel or Plesk. Those last two panels have safeguards in place to prevent a misconfiguration error. But, it does happen very often when managing your own VPS.

Looking for more help with this one? Follow our guide on how to fix a 502 bad gateway error.

500 Internal Server Error
The big bad boy of errors. The 500 internal server error is the worse of them all, primarily because is such a general error. If you don’t have sufficient knowledge on how to deal with it, it can be a real pain as it can bring your entire site down. The 502 bad gateway error also throws your site down but it’s easier to diagnose and fix. As mentioned, it is almost always related to the FPM configuration.

Reasons for a 500 Internal Server Error & How to Fix Them
The first thing to understand about a 500 error is that it can be caused by a number of different factors that are almost always related to failures in code execution. Instead of trying to diagnose everything at once, I’ll give you a list of errors by type of problem and what you were doing.

By migrating an older site to a newer hosting
An error in the .htaccess in an apache configuration
An error in PHP code execution
There are other less common cases that can throw a 500 internal server error but for the sake of simplicity and usability of this article I’m going to focus on these three.

1. Migrating an Older Site to Newer Hosting
There are several ways in which this error can show up but almost always seems related to the PHP version that is bound to your webserver. Newer PHP versions can generate an immediate 500 internal server error if the current site or plugins do not support the current version.

This error is classic for example, when you migrate your site from a mediocre hosting with an older PHP version to a newer hosting that only accept the newer versions (7.0 and up). If your site was not updated recently, an old plugin may be causing an issue. I call this the “migration internal server error” because it almost always happens when you migrate a site.

Solution
The best way to fix this terrible error when you’re trying so hard to migrate your WordPress site to new hosting is to make a complete copy of your plugins and the theme of your site. After doing this, please, delete all the plugins from your site and try again. If the error goes away, it is almost guaranteed that the error was generated by a newer version of PHP on your hosting that just simply refuses to execute code on your older plugin. By re-uploading one plugin at a time you can easily find out which was the one causing the issue.

This errors are almost always presenting themselves when migrating older sites running on PHP 5.4 and 5.6 to a newer hosting with PHP 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2.

The same thing applies to your theme. Since themes can and do implement extra PHP code in the functions.php, single and page.php files. It is most probably that an older theme without updates can break your site once migrated to a hosting with a newer version of PHP, this situation is unfortunate as the only way of fixing this is to change the theme and rebuild your site. This is the worse case scenario.

straw berry에 관하여

```
They grew in the wild of their own accord, their berries gathered by folks who happened across strawberry patches. ... One explanation hinges on a particular meaning of “straw” a particle of straw, chaff, or mote describing the appearance of the achenes (tiny yellow seeds) scattered over the surface of the berry.
```

```
The common theory is that the origin of the word “strawberry” is based on the practice growing the plants with a layer of straw mulch to help retain moisture, deter pests, and keep the berries cleaner for picking. There is also a thought that they were simply packaged in straw when being brought to market.

There is one problem with this theory which in this article from Snopes http://www.snopes.com/language/notthink/strawberry.asp sums up very nicely:
```

```
Nobody knows for sure. We know that it comes from the Old English strēawberige, but strēaw itself is just Old English for straw, so that doesn’t get us any closer to the answer.

One theory is that the name comes from the appearance of the achenes (the tiny white seeds) on the surface of the berry which look a little like tiny bits of straw.

Another theory is that the berries were often found mixed in with hay or straw in the fields (Note, however, that the fact gardeners often use a layer of straw to protect young plants should have no bearing on the name — the use of the name predates any deliberate cultivation of the berries).

A more fanciful theory is that the name is derived from the practice in some European counties of picking berries and threading them on straws.

The best theory I have found is that it is related to the word “strew” meaning to spread haphazardly along the ground. Strawberries propagate through the droppings of birds and animals that eat them, leading to a wide dispersal of separate berry “colonies”.

Etymologically, the word strew can be traced as follows :

from the Proto-Indo-European strew (“to spread, scatter”) to
the Proto-Germanic strawjana (“to strew”) to
the Old-English strewian, strēawian, strēowian (“to strew, scatter”)
to Middle English strewen, strawen, streowen

It’s easy to imagine how strew could have become straw, resulting in “strawberries”.

무도 확실히 모릅니다. 우리는 그것이 고대 영어 strēawberige 에서 온다는 것을 알고 있지만 strēaw 자체는 빨대에 대한 고대 영어 일 뿐이므로 답에 더 가깝게 도달하지 못합니다.

한 가지 이론은 그 이름이 베리의 표면에 작은 짚 조각처럼 보이는 수과 (작은 흰색 씨앗)의 출현에서 비롯된 것입니다.

또 다른 이론은 열매가 종종 들판에서 건초 나 짚과 섞여서 발견된다는 것입니다 (그러나 정원사는 종종 어린 식물을 보호하기 위해 짚 층을 사용한다는 사실은 이름과 관계가 없어야합니다. 열매를 고의적으로 재배하기 이전).

더 환상적인 이론은 이름이 일부 유럽 카운티의 열매를 따서 빨대에 실을 꿰는 관행에서 파생되었다는 것입니다.

내가 찾은 최고의 이론은 그것이 땅을 따라 우연히 퍼지는 것을 의미하는 "strew"라는 단어와 관련이 있다는 것입니다. 딸기는이를 먹는 새와 동물의 배설물을 통해 번식하여 별도의 베리 "콜로니"가 광범위하게 분산됩니다.

어원 학적으로 strew라는 단어는 다음과 같이 추적 할 수 있습니다.

Elizabeth Raffald (1733 – 19 April 1781) was an English author, innovator and entrepreneur.

Born and raised in Doncaster, Yorkshire, Raffald went into domestic service for fifteen years, ending as the housekeeper to the Warburton baronets at Arley Hall, Cheshire. She left her position when she married John, the estate's head gardener. The couple moved to Manchester, Lancashire, where Raffald opened a register office to introduce domestic workers to employers; she also ran a cookery school and sold food from the premises. In 1769 she published her cookery book The Experienced English Housekeeper, which contains the first recipe for a "Bride Cake" that is recognisable as a modern wedding cake. She is possibly the inventor of the Eccles cake.

In August 1772 Raffald published The Manchester Directory, a listing of 1,505 traders and civic leaders in Manchester—the first such listing for the up-and-coming town. The Raffalds went on to run two important post houses in Manchester and Salford before running into financial problems, possibly brought on by John's heavy drinking. Raffald began a business selling strawberries and hot drinks during the strawberry season. She died suddenly in 1781, just after publishing the third edition of her directory and while still updating the eighth edition of her cookery book.

After her death there were fifteen official editions of her cookery book, and twenty-three pirated ones. Her recipes were heavily plagiarised by other authors, notably by Isabella Beeton in her bestselling Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861). Raffald's recipes have been admired by several modern cooks and food writers, including Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson.

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 8 February 2021, more than 106 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2.31 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to severe illness. The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other.[b] It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces. People remain infectious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they do not show symptoms.[9]

Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines are being developed and distributed. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms while work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.

The responses to the pandemic have resulted in global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[10] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Many educational institutions have been partially or fully closed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[11]

Apollo 14 was the eighth crewed mission in the United States Apollo program, the third to land on the Moon, and the first to land in the lunar highlands. It was the last of the "H missions", landings at specific sites of scientific interest on the Moon for two-day stays with two lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs or moonwalks).

The mission was originally scheduled for 1970, but was postponed because of the investigation following the failure of Apollo 13 to reach the Moon's surface, and the need for modifications to the spacecraft as a result. Commander Alan Shepard, Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell launched on their nine-day mission on Sunday, January 31, 1971, at 4:03:02 p.m. EST. En route to the lunar landing, the crew overcame malfunctions that might have resulted in a second consecutive aborted mission, and possibly, the premature end of the Apollo program.

Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro formation – originally the target of Apollo 13. During the two walks on the surface, they collected 94.35 pounds (42.80 kg) of Moon rocks and deployed several scientific experiments. To the dismay of some geologists, Shepard and Mitchell did not reach the rim of Cone crater as had been planned, though they came close. In Apollo 14's most famous incident, Shepard hit two golf balls he had brought with him with a makeshift club.

While Shepard and Mitchell were on the surface, Roosa remained in lunar orbit aboard the Command and Service Module, performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future Apollo 16 mission. He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were germinated on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees, that were widely distributed in the following years. After liftoff from the surface and a successful docking, the spacecraft was flown back to Earth where the three astronauts splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean on February 9.

Operation PBHistory was a covert operation carried out in Guatemala by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It followed Operation PBSuccess, which led to the overthrow of Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in June 1954 and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. PBHistory attempted to use documents left behind by Árbenz's government and by organizations related to the communist Guatemalan Party of Labor to demonstrate that the Guatemalan government had been under the influence of the Soviet Union, and to use those documents to obtain further intelligence that would be useful to US intelligence agencies. It was an effort to justify the overthrow of the elected Guatemalan government in response to the negative international reactions to PBSuccess.[1] The CIA also hoped to improve its intelligence resources about communist parties in Latin America, a subject on which it had little information.

The first phase of the operation began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954: several agents were dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of the CIA and the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.

PBHistory documents were used to support the CIA's existing operations Kufire and Kugown, which sought to track Latin American communists and to disseminate information critical of the Árbenz government. Documents were also shared with the Kersten Committee of the US House of Representatives, which publicized PBHistory within the US. The documents uncovered by the operation proved useful to the Guatemalan intelligence agencies, enabling the creation of a register of suspected communists. Operation PBHistory did not succeed in its chief objective of finding evidence that the Guatemalan communists were being controlled by the Soviet government, and was unable to counter the international narrative that the United States had toppled the government of Jacobo Árbenz to serve the interests of the United Fruit Company.

Bird eggs are laid by females and incubated for a variable duration depending on the species. This diagram shows a cross-section of a chicken egg on its ninth day of incubation. The embryo is surrounded by the amnion, a membrane that fills with amniotic fluid and cushions it against shock; the allantois helps the embryo obtain oxygen and handles metabolic waste; the vitellus, or yolk, is the nutrient-bearing portion of the egg, containing most of its fat, minerals, and many of its proteins and blood vessels; the chorion forms the amniotic sac and encloses the other structures; the albumen protects the yolk and embryo and provides additional nutrients; the porous shell allows oxygen to enter while keeping unwanted fluids and contaminants out.

>  How CSS works

```
We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to write simple stylesheets. In this lesson we will take a look at how a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, basic software installed, basic knowledge of working with files, and HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML.)
Objective:	To understand the basics of how CSS and HTML are parsed by the browser, and what happens when a browser encounters CSS it does not understand.
How does CSS actually work?
When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.

The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).
The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).
The following diagram also offers a simple view of the process.



About the DOM
A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.

Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.

A real DOM representation
Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's look at an example to see how a real HTML snippet is converted into a DOM.

Take the following HTML code:

<p>
  Let's use:
  <span>Cascading</span>
  <span>Style</span>
  <span>Sheets</span>
</p>
In the DOM, the node corresponding to our <p> element is a parent. Its children are a text node and the three nodes corresponding to our <span> elements. The SPAN nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their children:

P
├─ "Let's use:"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Cascading"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Style"
└─ SPAN
   └─ "Sheets"
This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet —it renders the above DOM tree and then outputs it in the browser like so:



Applying CSS to the DOM
Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the HTML is as follows:

<p>
  Let's use:
  <span>Cascading</span>
  <span>Style</span>
  <span>Sheets</span>
</p>
Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:

span {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: lime;
}
The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a span selector, the browser will be able to sort the CSS very quickly! It will apply that rule to each one of the three <span>s, then paint the final visual representation to the screen.

The updated output is as follows:



In our Debugging CSS article in the next module we will be using browser DevTools to debug CSS problems, and will learn more about how the browser interprets CSS.

What happens if a browser encounters CSS it doesn't understand?
In an earlier lesson I mentioned that browsers do not all implement new CSS at the same time. In addition, many people are not using the latest version of a browser. Given that CSS is being developed all the time, and is therefore ahead of what browsers can recognize, you might wonder what happens if a browser encounters a CSS selector or declaration it doesn't recognize.

The answer is that it does nothing, and just moves on to the next bit of CSS!

If a browser is parsing your rules, and encounters a property or value that it doesn't understand, it ignores it and moves on to the next declaration. It will do this if you have made an error and misspelled a property or value, or if the property or value is just too new and the browser doesn't yet support it.

Similarly, if a browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one.

In the example below I have used the British English spelling for color, which makes that property invalid as it is not recognized. So my paragraph has not been colored blue. All of the other CSS have been applied however; only the invalid line is ignored.

<p> I want this text to be large, bold and blue.</p>
p {
  font-weight: bold;
  colour: blue; /* incorrect spelling of the color property */
  font-size: 200%;
}


This behavior is very useful. It means that you can use new CSS as an enhancement, knowing that no error will occur if it is not understood — the browser will either get the new feature or not. Coupled with the way that the cascade works, and the fact that browsers will use the last CSS they come across in a stylesheet when you have two rules with the same specificity you can also offer alternatives for browsers that don't support new CSS.

This works particularly well when you want to use a value that is quite new and not supported everywhere. For example, some older browsers do not support calc() as a value. I might give a fallback width for a box in pixels, then go on to give a width with a calc() value of 100% - 50px. Old browsers will use the pixel version, ignoring the line about calc() as they don't understand it. New browsers will interpret the line using pixels, but then override it with the line using calc() as that line appears later in the cascade.

.box {
  width: 500px;
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
We will look at many more ways to support varying browsers in later lessons.

And finally
You've nearly finished this module; we only have one more thing to do. In the next article you'll use your new knowledge to restyle an example, testing out some CSS in the process.
